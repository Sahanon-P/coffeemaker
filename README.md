# Coffee Maker's
The Computer Science department at NCSU has a new building on Centennial Campus. We all know that computer scientists love caffeine,
so the CSC department is planning on installing a CoffeeMaker in a lounge across the hall from the 24-hour computer lab. Our job is to test
and model the functionality of the CoffeeMaker. We are only working with the logic code behind the hardware, so only a command line
interface is used for manual testing. Here is a partial listing of requirements for the CoffeeMaker system. Use this as a reference when
completing the CSC 326 tutorials.
